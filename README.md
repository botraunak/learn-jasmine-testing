# Learn Jasmine Testing

This repository is a reference for me to learn unit testing with jasmine. 

## Step 0 Initial Setup
Clone this repository and get started with individual folders and have a look on how to get started with unit testing with jasmine. 

Steps to recreate the initial setup from scratch:

1. `npm init` and fill necessary details
2. `npm install -D jasmine` Install jasmine as a dev dependency
3. `npm install -D jasmine-spec-reporter` For better reporting on the terminal
4. Create `jasmine.json` as the configuration file
5. Update npm script `test`  

Note: This is a very basic step up to learn jasmine and not use it for productions and this readme is a reference for me.
